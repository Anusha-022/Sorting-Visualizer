# Sorting-Visualizer

This project demonstrates the working of different sorting algorithms in a graphical form.
The graphical UI is able to visualize the sorting process using various colors or denote the status of the elements in the array. 
It includes features to select the size of the data (array of random numbers) and the desired sorting algorithm.
The data set is represented as a vertical bar with the height of their respective values. 
After the sorting is started, the stepwise arrangement of data based on the algorithm selected will be visualized.

Achievements:
1. Created a Graphical UI/UX visualization tool using colors and chart types for denoting the status of elements in the array.
2. User can input the desired data into the array and select the desired sort.
3. Benefited the students to easily grasp the concepts of the respective algorithms through this visualization tool.
 
Languages used: 
  C++
